# SetAltitudeRange
A little userscript that allows you to manipulate the maximum and minimum values of the height map on https://topographic-map.com

## How to install ##
Either Paste the script into the browser console, or have it load automatically using an extension like Tampermonkey.

## How to use ##
 - Unlock the heightmap (uncheck the checkbox next to the lock icon on the right hand side)
 - Set your wanted altitude range
 - Click the "Set Altitude Range" button
 - Lock the heightmap (check the checkbox next to the lock icon on the right hand side)

Always unlock the heightmap before setting a new range, as otherwise the new range won't be saved and will be reverted as soon as you move the map or otherwise update it.
